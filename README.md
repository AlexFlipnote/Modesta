# ModestaCSS 2.0
A clean CSS framework made to be dark and responsive.

## Install to your website
```html
<!-- Use this line to have the theme on your website -->
<link href="https://modesta.alexflipnote.dev/css/modesta.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
```
If you wish to use local files, please copy the CSS folder into your website.
Everything from images and all CSS packages is included inside it.

## Best practice
Include these inside `<head>` to ensure that the responsiveness works well and all UTF-8 characters work, in case you use any symbols like copyright, other language letters, etc.
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"/>
```

## Colour scheme
Here's the main colour scheme to ModestaCSS if you're going to need them to build on-top of it with your own CSS components:
```
highlight    #181818    rgb(24, 24, 24)
primary      #282828    rgb(40, 40, 40)
