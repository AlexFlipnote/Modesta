description: Make a lovely paper layout for a document or anything
---
Paper Container is made for those who want a lovely layout of a paper to their homepage or documentation.
You can customize what colours it shows by replacing COLOUR with any colour you wish for, and this also supports markdown-container as well by adding it to `paper`.

To change the paper colour, replace COLOUR with what you need and remember to have a `-paper` in the end of it.
```html
<div class="paper-container">
  <div class="ribbon COLOUR"></div>
  <div class="paper COLOUR-paper">
    <!-- Any content inside here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
