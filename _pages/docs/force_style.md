description: Forcing elements to use a specific style

These classes will enforce style to an object, so you don't need to use `style=""` on many objects. If there's room for more styles, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/ModestaCSS/issues).

NOTE: All objects are presented as **span** for example, but it can be used
on anything if you want.
```html
<span class="bold">Make any text bold</span>
<span class="box-shadow">Add box shadow on any box</span>
<span class="center-text">Only make the text inside center aligned</span>
<span class="left-text">Only make the text inside left aligned</span>
<span class="right-text">Only make the text inside right aligned</span>
<span class="center">Make anything inside center aligned</span>
<span class="full-width">Forces object to have 100% width</span>
<span class="half-width">Forces object to have 50% width</span>
<span class="no-border-radius">Remove border radius from object</span>
<span class="no-border">Remove borders from object</span>
<span class="no-margin">Remove margin from object</span>
<span class="no-padding">Remove padding from object</span>
<span class="no-select">Remove the text marker</span>
<span class="transparent">Make the object's background transparent</span>
```
